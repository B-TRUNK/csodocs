The .NET class library defines built-in numeric types and complex types that represent
a wide variety of constructs. These constructs include the file system, network connections,
collections and arrays of objects, and dates.

C# also supports structural types, such as tuples and anonymous types.
Structural types are defined by the names and types of each member,
and the order of members in an expression. Structural types don't have unique names.

The compiler uses type information to make sure all operations that are performed in
your code are type safe.

*bool isn't convertible to int.

The compiler embeds the type information into the executable file as metadata.
The common language runtime (CLR) uses that metadata at run time to further guarantee
type safety when it allocates and reclaims memory.

When you declare a variable or constant in a program, you must either specify its type
or use the var keyword to let the compiler infer the type

*see Casting and Type Conversions.

Built-in types
--------------
C# provides a standard set of built-in types. These types represent integers,
floating point values, Boolean expressions, text characters, decimal values, and other
types of data. The language also includes built-in string and object types.
You can use these types in any C# program. For a complete list of the built-in types,
see Built-in types.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types

The following table lists the C# built-in value types:
------------------------------------------------------
C# type keyword 	.NET type
bool 	            System.Boolean
byte 	            System.Byte
sbyte 	            System.SByte
char 	            System.Char
decimal 	        System.Decimal
double 	            System.Double
float 	            System.Single
int 	            System.Int32
uint 	            System.UInt32
nint 	            System.IntPtr
nuint 	            System.UIntPtr
long 	            System.Int64
ulong 	            System.UInt64
short 	            System.Int16
ushort          	System.UInt16


The following table lists the C# built-in reference types:
----------------------------------------------------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/reference-types#the-delegate-type

C# type keyword 	.NET type
object 	            System.Object
string 	            System.String
delegate 	        System.Delegate
dynamic 	        System.Object


The delegate type
-----------------
The declaration of a delegate type is similar to a method signature. It has a return
value and any number of parameters of any type:

public delegate void MessageDelegate(string message);
public delegate int AnotherDelegate(MyType m, long num);

In .NET, System.Action and System.Func types provide generic definitions for many
common delegates. You likely don't need to define new custom delegate types. Instead,
you can create instantiations of the provided generic types.

A delegate is a built-in reference type that can be used to encapsulate a named or an
anonymous method. Delegates are similar to function pointers in C++; however,
delegates are type-safe and secure. For applications of delegates, see Delegates and
Generic Delegates. Delegates are the basis for Events. A delegate can be instantiated
by associating it either with a named or anonymous method.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/generic-delegates
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/events/

The delegate must be instantiated with a method or lambda expression that has a
compatible return type and input parameters. For more information on the degree of
variance that is allowed in the method signature, see Variance in Delegates.
For use with anonymous methods, the delegate and the code to be associated with it
are declared together.

*Custom types
-------------
Use the struct, class, interface, enum, and record constructs to create your own
custom types. 

*Enum
-----
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/enum

*Record
-------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record


*One of the first decisions you make when defining a type is deciding which construct to use for your type. The following list helps make that initial decision. Some choices overlap. In most scenarios, more than one option is a reasonable choice.

    If the data type isn't part of your app domain and doesn't include behavior, use a structural type.
    If the data storage size is small, no more than 64 bytes, choose a struct or record struct.
    If the type is immutable, or you want nondestructive mutation, choose a struct or record struct.
    If your type should have value semantics for equality, choose a record class or record struct.
    If the type is primarily for storing data, with minimal behavior, choose a record class or record struct.
    If the type is part of an inheritance hierarchy, choose a record class or a class.
    If the type uses polymorphism, choose a class.
    If the primary purpose is behavior, choose a class.

You can also choose an interface to model a contract: behavior described by members
that can be implemented by unrelated types. Interfaces are abstract and declare members
that must be implemented by all class or struct types that inherit from that interface.


*Generic types
--------------
Declare a type with one or more (type parameters) that act as placeholders for the actual
type (the concrete type). Client code provides the concrete type when it creates an 
instance of the type. These types are called generic types. For example, the .NET type 
System.Collections.Generic.List<T> has one type parameter that by convention is named T.
When you create an instance of the type, you specify the type of the objects that the
list contains, such as string:

List<string> stringList = new List<string>();
stringList.Add("String example");
// compile time error adding a type other than a string:
stringList.Add(4);

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=net-10.0
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/generics


// Declare the generic class.
public class GenericList<T>
{
    public void Add(T item) { }
}

public class ExampleClass { }

class TestGenericList
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a list of type int.
        GenericList<int> list1 = new();
        list1.Add(1);

        // Create a list of type string.
        GenericList<string> list2 = new();
        list2.Add("");

        // Create a list of type ExampleClass.
        GenericList<ExampleClass> list3 = new();
        list3.Add(new ExampleClass());
    }
}

Generics are most frequently used with collections and the methods that operate on them.
The System.Collections.Generic namespace contains several generic-based collection
classes. The nongeneric collections, such as ArrayList aren't recommended and are
maintained only for compatibility purposes. For more information, see Generics in .NET.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/generics/

The type parameter T is used in several locations where a concrete type would ordinarily be used to indicate the type of the item stored in the list:

    As the type of a method parameter in the AddHead method.
    As the return type of the Data property in the nested Node class.
    As the type of the private member data in the nested class.

T is available to the nested Node class. When GenericList<T> is instantiated with a
concrete type, for example as a GenericList<int>, each occurrence of T is replaced
with int.

// Type parameter T in angle brackets.
public class GenericList<T>
{
    // The nested class is also generic, and
    // holds a data item of type T.
    private class Node(T t)
    {
        // T as property type.
        public T Data { get; set; } = t;

        public Node? Next { get; set; }
    }

    // First item in the linked list
    private Node? head;

    // T as parameter type.
    public void AddHead(T t)
    {
        Node n = new(t);
        n.Next = head;
        head = n;
    }

    // T in method return type.
    public IEnumerator<T> GetEnumerator()
    {
        Node? current = head;

        while (current is not null)
        {
            yield return current.Data;
            current = current.Next;
        }
    }
}

The following code example shows how client code uses the generic GenericList<T> class
to create a list of integers. If you change the type argument, the following code
creates lists of strings or any other custom type:

// A generic list of int.
GenericList<int> list = new();

// Add ten int values.
for (int x = 0; x < 10; x++)
{
    list.AddHead(x);
}

// Write them to the console.
foreach (int i in list)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}

Console.WriteLine("Done");


*Tuples and anonymous types
---------------------------
Creating a type for simple sets of related values can be inconvenient if you don't
intend to store or pass these values using public APIs. You can create tuples or 
anonymous types for this purpose. For more information, see tuples and Anonymous Types.

*Tuples
-------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples
*Anonymous
----------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/anonymous-types

*Nullable value Types
---------------------
Ordinary value types can't have a value of null. However, you can create nullable value
types by appending a ? after the type. For example, int? is an int type that can also
have the value null.

*Nullable value types
---------------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-value-types

Nullable value types are instances of the generic struct type System.Nullable<T>
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.nullable-1?view=net-10.0

======================================================================================

b) Namespaces
-------------

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/namespaces

Namespaces are heavily used in C# programming in two ways. First,
.NET uses namespaces to organize its many classes, as follows:

System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

System is a namespace and Console is a class in that namespace. The using keyword can
be used so that the complete name isn't required, as in the following example:

using System;
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

see the using directive.

c) Class:
---------

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes

Reference types

A type that is defined as a class is a reference type. At run time, when you declare
a variable of a reference type, the variable contains the value null until you
explicitly create an instance of the class by using the new operator,
or assign it an object of a compatible type created elsewhere.

When the object is created, enough memory is allocated on the managed heap for that
specific object, and the variable holds only a reference to the location of said object.
When an instance of a class is created, a reference to the object is passed back to
the programmer.
The memory used by an object is reclaimed by the automatic memory management
functionality of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which is known as 
garbage collection. For more information about garbage collection, 
see Automatic memory management and garbage collection.

*** Garbage Collection Fundamentals:
------------------------------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals


*The default access for a class type is internal

*Every .NET type has a default value. Typically, that value is 0 for number types,
and null for all reference types. You can rely on that default value when it's reasonable in your app.

*Class inheritance:
-------------------
Classes fully support inheritance, a fundamental characteristic of object-oriented 
programming. When you create a class, you can inherit from any other class that isn't 
defined as sealed. Other classes can inherit from your class and override class 
virtual methods. Furthermore, you can implement one or more interfaces.

*sealed_classes
---------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/sealed

*inheritance
------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/object-oriented/inheritance

A class can be declared as abstract. An abstract class contains abstract methods that
have a signature definition but no implementation. Abstract classes can't be 
instantiated. They can only be used through derived classes that implement the abstract
methods. By contrast, a sealed class doesn't allow other classes to derive from it.
