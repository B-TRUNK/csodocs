In C#, the difference between
value, reference, and the parameter modifiers ref (reference) and out (output) lies in how data is passed to methods and how changes within the method affect the original variable. 
Value (Pass-by-Value)
This is the default mechanism for passing parameters. 

    Mechanism: A copy of the actual value of the argument is passed to the 
    method.
    Effect: Changes made to the parameter inside the method have no effect on 
    the original argument in the calling code, because the method is operating
    on a separate copy.
    Usage: All built-in simple types like int, char, float, and bool, as well 
    as structs, are value types and are passed by value unless a modifier is 
    specified. 


void Increment(int i) // Pass by value
{
    i = i + 1; // Changes the copy
}

int arg = 10;
Increment(arg);
Console.WriteLine(arg); // Output: 10


Reference (ref modifier)
The ref keyword allows a method to modify the original variable directly. 

    Mechanism: A reference to the original memory location of the argument is 
    passed to the method. The parameter and the original argument point to 
    the same data.
    Effect: Any changes made to the parameter inside the method will affect 
    the original argument in the calling code. Data is passed bi-directionally
    (in and out).
    Initialization: The variable must be initialized in the calling method 
    before it can be passed using ref.
    Usage: Useful when the method needs to read the initial value of a 
    variable and potentially modify it, with the change being reflected in 
    the caller. 


void IncrementRef(ref int i) // Pass by reference using 'ref'
{
    i = i + 1; // Changes the original variable
}

int arg = 10;
IncrementRef(ref arg);
Console.WriteLine(arg); // Output: 11


Output (out modifier)
The out keyword is used for parameters that the called method is expected to assign before returning. It's often used when a method needs to return multiple values. 

    Mechanism: Similar to ref, it passes a reference to the memory location, 
    but with specific compiler rules. Data is passed only unidirectionally 
    (out of the method to the caller).
    Effect: The method must assign a value to the out parameter before it 
    returns, otherwise a compile-time error occurs. This value then becomes 
    the value of the original variable in the calling code.
    Initialization: The variable does not need to be initialized in the 
    calling method before being passed using out; any prior value is ignored.
    Usage: Primarily for getting output from the method, typically as a 
    secondary return value (e.g., Type.TryParse() pattern). 


void GetValue(out int i) // Pass as output using 'out'
{
    // Cannot read 'i' before assigning a value
    i = 10; // Must assign a value before returning
}

// int arg; // Initialization is optional before the call
GetValue(out int arg); // C# 7+ inline declaration
Console.WriteLine(arg); // Output: 10


Discards (using _ as an identifier)
Starting with C# 7.0, you can use the underscore (_) as a discard when you are not interested in the value of a specific out parameter. A discard is a nameless, write-only variable that cannot be read from. 

public bool TryGetValues(out int value1, out string value2)
{
    value1 = 1;
    value2 = "hello";
    return true;
}

// Call the method, discarding the string value
TryGetValues(out int result, out _);

Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}"); // Output: Result: 1
// Console.WriteLine(_); // This would cause a compiler error
