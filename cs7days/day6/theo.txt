The Task asynchronous programming (TAP) model

*Task asynchronous programming (TAP) model
-----------------------------------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/asynchronous-programming/task-asynchronous-programming-model

provides a layer of abstraction over 
typical asynchronous coding. In this model, you write code as a sequence of statements
, the same as usual. The difference is you can read your task-based code as the 
compiler processes each statement and before it starts processing the next statement.
To accomplish this model, the compiler performs many transformations to complete 
each task. Some statements can initiate work and return a Task

object that represents
the ongoing work and the compiler must resolve these transformations. The goal of 
task asynchronous programming is to enable code that reads like a sequence of 
statements, but executes in a more complicated order. Execution is based on 
external resource allocation and when tasks complete.
task asynchronous programming model is analogous to how people give 
instructions for processes that include asynchronous tasks. This article uses an 
example with instructions for making breakfast to show how the async and await 
keywords make it easier to reason about code that includes a series of asynchronous 
instructions.
