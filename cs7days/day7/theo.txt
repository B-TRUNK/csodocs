Unsafe code, pointer types, and function pointers
-------------------------------------------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/unsafe-code

C# supports an unsafe context, in which you can write unverifiable code. In 
an unsafe context, code can use pointers, allocate and free blocks of memory, 
and call methods using function pointers. Unsafe code in C# isn't necessarily 
dangerous; it's just code whose safety can't be verified.

Unsafe code has the following properties:
-----------------------------------------
    Methods, types, and code blocks can be defined as unsafe.
    In some cases, unsafe code can increase an application's performance by 
    enabling direct memory access through pointers to avoid array bounds 
    checks.
    Unsafe code is required when you call native functions that require pointers.
    Using unsafe code introduces security and stability risks.
    The code that contains unsafe blocks must be compiled with the 
    AllowUnsafeBlocks compiler option.
