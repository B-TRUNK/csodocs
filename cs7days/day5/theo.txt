Delegates (C# Programming Guide)
--------------------------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/

A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular 
parameter list and return type. When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate 
the delegate instance with any method that has a compatible signature and return 
type. You can invoke (or call) the method through the delegate instance.

Delegates are used to pass methods as arguments to other methods. Event handlers are 
essentially methods you invoke through delegates. When you create a custom method, a 
class such as a Windows control can call your method when a certain event occurs.

public delegate int PerformCalculation(int x, int y);

You can assign any method from any accessible class or struct that matches the 
delegate type to the delegate. The method can be either static or an instance method. 
The flexibility allows you to programmatically change method calls, or plug new code 
into existing classes.

*Note
In the context of method overloading, the signature of a method doesn't include the 
return value. However, in the context of delegates, the signature does include the 
return value. In other words, a method must have a compatible return type as the 
return type declared by the delegate.

The ability to refer to a method as a parameter makes delegates ideal for defining 
callback methods. You can write a method that compares two objects in your 
application. The method can then be used in a delegate for a sort algorithm. Because 
the comparison code is separate from the library, the sort method can be more general.

Function pointers support similar scenarios, where you need more control over the 
calling convention. The code associated with a delegate is invoked by using a virtual
method added to a delegate type. When you work with function pointers, you can 
specify different conventions.

Explore delegate characteristics
---------------------------------
Delegates have the following characteristics:

    Delegates allow methods to be passed as parameters.
    Delegates can be used to define callback methods.
    Delegates can be chained together, such as calling multiple methods on a single event.
    Methods don't have to match the delegate type exactly. For more information, 
    see Using Variance in Delegates.

    Lambda expressions are a more concise way of writing inline code blocks. Lambda expressions (in certain contexts) are compiled to delegate types.

Using Delegates
---------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/using-delegates

A delegate is a type that safely encapsulates a method, similar to a function pointer 
in C and C++. Unlike C function pointers, delegates are object-oriented, type safe, 
and secure. The following example declares a delegate named Callback that can 
encapsulate a method that takes a string as an argument and returns void:

public delegate void Callback(string message);

// Create a method for a delegate.
public static void DelegateMethod(string message)
{
    Console.WriteLine(message);
}

// Instantiate the delegate.
Callback handler = DelegateMethod;

// Call the delegate.
handler("Hello World");
