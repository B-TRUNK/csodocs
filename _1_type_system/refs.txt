"A type that is defined as a class is a reference type. 
At run time, when you declare a variable of a reference type,
the variable contains the value null until you explicitly create an instance of the
class by using the new operator,
or assign it an object of a compatible type created elsewhere

When the object is created, enough memory is allocated on the managed heap for that
specific object, and the variable holds only a reference to the location of said object.
The memory used by an object is reclaimed by the automatic memory management functionality
of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which is known as garbage collection. 

Every .NET type has a default value. Typically, that value is 0 for number types,
and null for all reference types. You can rely on that default value when it's 
reasonable in your app."

**Beginning with C# 12, you can define a "primary constructor" as part of the class declaration:
public class Container(int capacity)
{
    private int _capacity = capacity;
}

You can also use the required modifier on a property and allow callers to use an object initializer to set the initial value of the property:
public class Person
{
    public required string LastName { get; set; }
    public required string FirstName { get; set; }
}

The addition of the required keyword mandates that callers must set those properties as part of a new expression:

var p1 = new Person(); // Error! Required properties not set
var p2 = new Person() { FirstName = "Grace", LastName = "Hopper" };

*Inheritance

When you create a class, you can inherit from any other class that isn't defined as "sealed"

A class can be declared as abstract. An abstract class contains abstract methods that have a signature definition but no
implementation. Abstract classes can't be instantiated. They can only be used through derived classes that
implement the abstract methods. By contrast, a sealed class doesn't allow other classes to derive from it.
