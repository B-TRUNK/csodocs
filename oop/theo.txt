Only single inheritance is allowed in C#. In other words, a class can inherit 
implementation from one base class only. However, a class can implement more than 
one interface. 

Classes that you declare directly within a namespace, not nested within other 
classes, can be either public or internal. Classes are internal by default.

Class members, including nested classes, can be public, protected internal, 
protected, internal, private, or private protected. Members are private by default.

*Access modifiers (C# programming guide)
----------------------------------------
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/access-modifiers



    public: Code in any assembly can access this type or member. The accessibility 
    level of the containing type controls the accessibility level of public members 
    of the type.

    private: Only code declared in the same class or struct can access this member.

    protected: Only code in the same class or in a derived class can access this 
    type or member.

    internal: Only code in the same assembly can access this type or member.

    protected internal: Only code in the same assembly or in a derived class in 
    another assembly can access this type or member.

    private protected: Only code in the same assembly and in the same class or a 
    derived class can access the type or member.


Use the file modifier for top-level (non-nested) types. The file modifier restricts 
access to code in the same source file. You can't combine the file modifier with any 
access modifier.

Inheritance
-----------
Classes (but not structs) support the concept of inheritance. 

Interfaces
----------
Classes, structs, and records can implement multiple interfaces. To implement from an 
interface means that the type implements all the methods defined in the interface.

Static Types
------------
Classes (but not structs or records) can be declared as static. A static class can 
contain only static members and can't be instantiated with the new keyword. One copy 
of the class is loaded into memory when the program loads, and its members are 
accessed through the class name. Classes, structs, and records can contain static 
members. 

Anonymous Types
---------------
In situations where it isn't convenient or necessary to create a named class you use 
anonymous types. Named data members define anonymous types.

Extension Members
-----------------
You can "extend" a class without creating a derived class by creating a separate type. 
That type contains methods that can be called as if they belonged to the original type.
