Struct Instances vs. Class Instances
------------------------------------
Because classes are reference types, a variable of a class object holds a reference 
to the address of the object on the managed heap. If a second variable of the same 
type is assigned to the first variable, then both variables refer to the object at 
that address

Instances of classes are created by using the new operator.
To create a new instance of a type, you typically invoke one of the constructors of 
that type using the new operator

Because structs are value types, a variable of a struct object holds a copy of the 
entire object. Instances of structs can also be created by using the new operator, 
but this isn't required,

struct objects p1, p2:
The memory for both p1 and p2 is allocated on the thread stack
