Pattern matching overview

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching

Pattern matching is a technique where you test an expression to determine if it has 
certain characteristics. C# pattern matching provides more concise syntax for 
testing expressions and taking action when an expression matches. 
The "is expression" supports pattern matching to test an expression and 
conditionally declare a new variable to the result of that expression. 
The "switch expression" enables you to perform actions based on the first matching 
pattern for an expression. These two expressions support a rich vocabulary of patterns.

This article provides an overview of scenarios where you can use pattern matching. 
These techniques can improve the readability and correctness of your code. For a 
full discussion of all the patterns you can apply, see the article on patterns in 
the language reference.

Null checks
-----------
One of the most common scenarios for pattern matching is to ensure values aren't 
null. You can test and convert a nullable value type to its underlying type while 
testing for null using the following example:

==========================================================================
int? maybe = 12;

if (maybe is int number)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"The nullable int 'maybe' has the value {number}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The nullable int 'maybe' doesn't hold a value");
}
